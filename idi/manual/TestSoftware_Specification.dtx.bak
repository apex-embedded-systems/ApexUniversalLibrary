* Power Requirements *
  * Power supply requirements: +5 V at 100 mA (estimated)
* Digital Inputs *
  * Opto&#45;isolator input current using 5V input signal and
    2.2K input resistor is typically 1.8 mA over temperature
    range.
  * 12K for nominal 28V. Transition region measured typically
    2.5 to 4.3 VDC over temperature range.
    * 4V @ 0.25mA, +/&#45; 30mA over temperature range
    * 20V @ 1.57mA, very consistent over temperature range.
    * 37V @ 2.97mA, very consistent over temperature range.
  * Isolated section to non&#45;isolated section voltage gap
    greater than +/&#45;1100 Volts DC
  * Contact us for variation in input resistance values
    * 2.2K for nominal 5V. Transition region measured
      typically 1.3 to 1.5 VDC over temperature range.
      * typically 1.8 mA with 5V applied to input over
        temperature range
* Bus Interface *
  * 10&#45;bit addressing modes. IOEXP can be optionally used
    as part of the address decoding
  * Contiguous I/O space is 16&#45;bytes. Note that A3 base
    address select is unused and can be used for other purposes.
    Refer to <link Compatibility Selection and Extended Functions>
    for further details.
  * 8&#45;bit or byte data width
  * STD&#45;Bus CMOS bus compatible.
    * Supports 5V logic levels: Vil_max \<= Vcc x 0.3,
      Vih_min \>= Vcc x 0.7. See note &#35;1 below.
      * Vcc = 4.8V: Vil_max = 1.4 V, Vih_min \>= 3.4 V (TTL
        outputs, require pull&#45;up which are on CPU board)
      * Vcc = 5.1V: Vil_max = 1.53 V, Vih_min \>= 3.6 V (TTL
        outputs, require pull&#45;up which are on CPU board)
      * Vcc = 3.3V: Vil_max = 0.8 V, Vih_min \>= 2 V
        (completely LVTTL compatible). See note &#35;2 below.
Notes:
  1. The 586 CPU board issues signals that are at least 4Vpp.
* Mechanical *
  * Dimensions: 4.5 x 6.5 inches
  * PCB is 4&#45;layer
  * Jumpers for address and interrupt selection use 2mm
    jumper shunts
* Environmental *
  * Operating temperature: <color Blue>&#45;40<sup>o</sup>C</color>
    to <color Red>+85<sup>o</sup>C</color>
  * Humidity: 5 to 95% (estimated)
