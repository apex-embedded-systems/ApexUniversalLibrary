@@Compatibility Selection and Extended Functions
Summary
The mode jumpers provide upwardly compatible feature
additions/enhancements without affecting existing hardware
installations. In other words, expand features and software
as the user might need.
Description
\ \ 

Currently no modes are implemented.



If 10-bit addressing and IOEXP is always ignored, then A3
jumper can be re-purposed to a mode jumper M2 to allow up to
eight possible hardware configuration/enhancement modes.
