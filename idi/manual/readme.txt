Readme File for Modifications of Support Files
Doc-O-Matic(R) Copyright (C) 2000-2007. All Rights Reserved.
----------------------------------------------------------------
The files in this folder are used by Doc-O-Matic during various 
stages in the input and output generation process. If you need 
to make modifications to one of them, please follow these steps:

1) Create a sub-folder named "support" in your personal 
   Doc-O-Matic project folder, that is:
     
   On Windows XP/2000 
   "C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\Doc-O-Matic"
   
   On Windows Vista
   "C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Doc-O-Matic"
   
2) Copy the file you wish to modify to this folder

3) Modify your personal copy, not the original. 

The original will be overwritten when you install new versions
of Doc-O-Matic, your personal copy will be left intact.
   
If you have a personal copy of a file, Doc-O-Matic will use 
that copy instead of the one in the default folder when it 
determines which file to use. For files like "scripts.js" and 
the html template files that is when you start the project. For 
files that are loaded dynamically (like the type conversion 
matrix) that is with every output run.

Note that if a feature is added to a new version of the files 
you need to make sure you keep your personal copy updated.
