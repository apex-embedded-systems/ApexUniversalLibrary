REVISION HISTORY  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE
This ReadMe applies to the aul_tree project being built as a shared resource.
The objective in doing so is to consume the library project from within the accompanying
C# executable when run within Mono.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW
This application demonstrates using C# and Mono to build a graphical user interface
to allow interaction and manipulation of an STX104 PC/104 card.
It is intended to be used to demonstrate utilization of the AUL library interface.
It is not intended to be used for production.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSUMPTIONS
-All file locations referenced within this document are relative to the ReadMe file location.
-required files are in place: aul_hwdef.txt ( hardware definition file ) and STX104_Demo.exe
-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP / INSTALLATION GUIDE
-To run the STX104 Demo Application for the first time a few setup steps are required.

1. Mono Complete must be installed. This is required to run the demo application. This can be accomplished by running:

$ sudo apt-get install mono-complete
--Normal installation steps apply. Answer yes when asked if you want to continue. Enter root password to allow install when prompted.



2.Install the correct library. Scripts have been provided to aid in this step.
 and are located in the _Demo_Csharp directory. There are two options for the library build. The simulator project that does not require hardware (Option A) and the full library (Option B)

2.(Option A) To use the simulator project use the build_aul_use_simulator script with the following command:

$ sh build_aul_use_simulator 
-- Root password will be required to copy library to /usr/lib


2.(Option B) 
To install the full library ( for use with STX104 driver and hardware installed ) use the build_aul_use_driver script with the following command:
$ sh build_aul_use_driver 
-- Root password will be required to copy library to /usr/lib

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUN THE DEMO


A launch script has been provided to aid in setting Mono and starting the application. 
To run the application navigate to the _Demo_Csharp directory and run the following command:

$ sudo sh launch
